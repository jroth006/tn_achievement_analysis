### Data and Approach
We used IRS tax data for the state of Tennessee to review income levels by zip code, along with other financial variables, to find correlation with county level school data. We analyzed school and tax data separately, as well as their influence on each other. The data sources for our research have been included in our [Sources Cited](#sources-cited). 


### Our Observations
Need to plug in boxplot interpretation......  
Southwest Memphis Core seems to have more variation in ACT Composite scores than any other region in the state. 

```{r act_by_core, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
combined_df %>% 
  filter(zip_code != 0 | zip_code != 99999) %>% 
  filter(agi_range != 'Total') %>% 
  filter(CORE_region != 'NA') %>% 
  filter(ACT_Composite != 'NA') %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x=CORE_region, y=ACT_Composite)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))

```

### Including Plots  


```{r ACT_county_map, include=FALSE}
#plot(goes here)
# need to clean - dekalb = DeKalb
# consolidate code for Rmd
library(maps)
library(mapdata)  #preloaded state/county coordinates

TN_data <- map_data("state") %>% 
  filter(region =='tennessee')
TN_counties <- map_data("county") %>% subset(., region == "tennessee")
TN_counties$subregion[TN_counties$subregion=='de kalb'] <- "dekalb"
combined_df$county_l <- sapply(combined_df$county, tolower) %>% gsub(' county','',.)
tax_school_map_df <- left_join(combined_df, TN_counties, by=c('county_l'='subregion')) 

color_df <- school_cross %>%
  select(CORE_region, County_Name, Enrollment, Per_Pupil_Expenditures, ACT_Composite) %>%
  group_by(County_Name) %>%
  summarise(Average_ACT_Composite = mean(ACT_Composite, na.rm = TRUE),
            Total_Per_Pupil_Expenditure = sum(Per_Pupil_Expenditures, na.rm = TRUE),
            Total_Enrollment  = sum(Enrollment, na.rm = TRUE),
            Avg_Per_Pupil_Exp = Total_Enrollment/Total_Per_Pupil_Expenditure)

color_df$county_l <- sapply(color_df$County_Name, tolower) %>% gsub(' county','',.)
color_df <- left_join(x = TN_counties, y = color_df, by = c("subregion" = "county_l"))

TN_map <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = color_df,
               aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Average_ACT_Composite),
               color = "white", size = 0.25) +
  coord_map() +
  scale_fill_distiller(name="ACT Scores", palette = "YlGn") +
  theme_nothing(legend = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Average ACT Composite Scores by County")
```

```{r ACT_map, echo=TRUE}
TN_map
```

### Grades Matter!   

Using data from the state achievement scores, we were able to accurately predict the average ACT scores for a county given the proficiency rates of four key subject categories: **Algebra I**, **Chemistry**, **Math**, and **ELA**. Using DeKalb County as a test county, we trained a prediction model on the other 94 counties in Tennessee and we able to predict DeKalb's ACT Composite score of 19.1.  
_lm(formula = ACT_Composite ~ AlgI + Chemistry + Math + ELA, data = school_cross_no_dekalb_no_outliers)_
